# Tip Calculator
_Created by user jc1399_

The purpose of this app is a tip calculator that: 
1. Takes as input the amount of the check and the number of people splitting the check
2. Produces as output both the amount of tip and the total amount each person should pay
for a 15%, 20%, and 25% tip. Output values must be computed assuming that the check
is split evenly and must be rounded to the nearest integer.
3. Visualizes an error using a Toast in case empty or invalid (e.g., negative) values are
provided as input.
